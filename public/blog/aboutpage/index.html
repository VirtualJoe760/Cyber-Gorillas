<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>Whats up guys, I'm Joe, A software engineer who's finally taking the jump into the tech industry. I figured what better way to get started then to create a tech blog! My plan for this website is to document my journey as a web developer, and give back knowlege to the community. See I'm all self taught at this point. It's been an absolute struggle to get to this point but I'm incredibly proud of what I've learned. Web design was always a part time &quot;hobby&quot; for me. I've always been interested in the nature of the internet and how it works, but never truly thought of it as a career. It was too overwhelming, and I always thought that If I ever took out the loans to go to school for it, I'd drop out, and it would be a huge mistake. Fast forward to today, man I wish I had done a bootcamp 10 years ago lol. It would have dramatically accelerated the learning process. See back then I didn't realize the reason they called programing a language was because once you learn it, you speak it just like a language. We don't think about how we speak english, we just do. Well today I'm here to tell you that you can get to the point where you eventually speak the language of web design.</p>
<h2>So my plan is pretty simple.</h2>
<p>I have this long time good buddy of mine, Benji Hernandez. See Benji and I go way back. We've both had our fair share of struggles, but have been around the world and back and realized we both want to be in tech. Benji, See he wants to be a Cyber Security Master and run all the networks. Me on the other hand, Well... I just told you I'm more of a web dev guy. Regardless we both have our journey forward and the best way to learn is to teach. The best way to teach, is to write down your experiences and learn from them. Thus Cyber Gorilla's was born!</p>
<h2>How's the blog going to be layed out?</h2>
<p>Well I figure, I will document the journey on my projects and Benji can document his journey on getting certifications. I'm also planning on using chatGPT to generate some basic content, to make up for lost time in basics that I learned years ago. It's pretty early in the process, so we'll see how far we can take this monkey business and are happy you are along for the journey.</p>
<p>So guys, If you have any ideas, we'd love to hear about it in the comments. Social links and eveything to come soon. In the mean time, no monkey business.</p>
<p>-- Joe</p>
