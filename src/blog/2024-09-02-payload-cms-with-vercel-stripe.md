So I've been taking the JSM course "Build and Deploy a Full Stack E-Commerce App with an Admin Dashboard & CMS in 2024 | Next 14, Stripe" and have been blown away with its simplicity so far. Everything payment & admin comes out the box with Payload. It is by far the most straight forward ecommerce experience i've had so far. I cannot wait to tell you guys more about the symplicity tomorrow, I'm going to publish this now, as im not expecting alot of viewers, and edit it in the morning. \
\
As a reminder for tomorrow, I will go over the simple changes in duplicating the env and getting the Database uri from payload, then the changes ive made to some of the scss files and implementing the font and my general thoughts on workflow in the future for ecommerce brands i work with in the future.
