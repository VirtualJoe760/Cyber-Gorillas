# Creating a "Hello, World!" Program in JavaScript: A Beginner's Guide

Hello and welcome to this beginner's tutorial on JavaScript! If you're new to programming or just new to JavaScript, you're in the right place. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through creating your very first JavaScript program: the classic "Hello, World!".

JavaScript is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages today, especially in web development. With JavaScript, you can build interactive websites, mobile apps, desktop applications, and much more. But for now, let's start with the basics.

## What you'll need:

- **Web Browser**: e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **Text Editor**: e.g., Notepad for Windows, TextEdit for Mac, or any code editor of your choice

## Let's get started!

### 1. Create a New HTML File

Open your text editor and create a new file. Save this file as `hello.html`. This file will serve as our webpage where we'll run our JavaScript code.

### 2. Set Up the Basic HTML Structure

Before we write our JavaScript code, let's set up a basic HTML structure. Use the following code:

<span style="color: green;">
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello, World! in JavaScript</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```
</span>

### 3. Add JavaScript to Your Page

There are multiple ways to add JavaScript to your webpage. For this tutorial, we'll use the `<script>` tag:

<span style="color: green;">
```html
<script>
    // This is where we'll write our JavaScript code.
</script>
```
</span>

### 4. Write the "Hello, World!" Program

Within the `<script>` tags, type the following JavaScript:
<pre><code>
<span style="color: green;">
javascript
alert('Hello, World!');

</span>
</pre></code>

### 5. Run Your Program

Open your `hello.html` file with any web browser. A popup alert box displaying the message "Hello, World!" should appear.

## Wrapping Up

This simple "Hello, World!" program is a traditional introduction to a new programming language. It's a foundational step in your JavaScript journey. As you continue, you'll unlock the vast capabilities of JavaScript. Happy coding!
